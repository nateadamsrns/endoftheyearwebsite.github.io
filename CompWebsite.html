                        <P>The range and the development of these components is endless and in the future I 
                            expect many more upgrades to these components. For example in recent years there
                            has been many upgrades of the cores and threads of the CPU's. Cores and Threads 
                            do a lot for the computer and really helps it to run efficently and allow you to 
                            run many applications all at the same time without it over heating. The CPU also 
                            needs to use a compound named Thermal Paste or Thermal Compound which is a metal 
                            that won't dry up but also won't hurt your chip and it allows to keep your CPU
                            cooled with the help of a CPU Fan.

                        <p>Graphic Cards are now starting to be more popular every year. They 
                            have started to compress the  graphic cards  so they can
                            not only fit in desktops but laptops as well. The graphic card is
                            the strongest and best graphic intesity you can possibly get at 
                            the moment. In desktops they are much larger so they can have better
                            cooling to allow it to run more efficent and not over heat like it may
                            do if you're doing something very graphically intense in a laptop.
                            Yes you may look at one of these things and think do I need one?
                            I would ask you what do you use your computer for? If they said 
                            video editing, gaming, crypto mining I would say yes you would need 
                            one. But if you don't do these things I would say no it is not necessary
                            because they are very expensive.
